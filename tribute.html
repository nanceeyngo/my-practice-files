    <h1>TRIBUTE TO A PRICELESS MUM</h1>
    <h2 class="secondheading" id="second">MAMA LIKE NO OTHER</h2>
    <p>To a self-sacrificing woman whose dedication to her family is evidenced by an unflinching perseverance, and written on the sands of time</p>
    <p class="line2">A strong woman; hard-pressed, but not broken</p>
    <p>Strengthened by the tide; toughened by the storms</p>
    <p>A mother in word and deed; her love and care, covering as a shield</p>
    <p>Unrelenting in affection; her heart, closely bound to those of her children</p>
    <p id="second">My Daddy's best friend; of course his girlfriend</p>
    <p>A shoulder to lean on; a true friend in distress</p>
    <p>A mother I would ask for over again; a most cherished asset, invaluable and irreplaceable</p>
    <p>A mother of all, a mother for all</p>
    <p id="second">Thank you Mum for all you do.</p>
    <p>You're indeed cherished!</p>
    <h1 class="birthday">Happy 50th Birthday!</h1>
